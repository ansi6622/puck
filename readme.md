# Puck
Very small template for very small apps.

Template inclues:
____
* ES6 transpiling via Bable
* Sass
* Live reloading for Chrome
* Simple HTTP server

## Style
* Add custom CSS to `src/sass/`

## Scripts
* Add custom JavaScript in `src/js/`

Everything is compiled into the `dist` directory.

## Server
1. In the terminal, `cd` into the puck directory
1. Run `npm run watch` to start a server and build assets.
1. Visit localhost:8080 to see it in action.

## Live Reloading

Install the [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livereload/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei/related). This will connect to the default port that the `node-livereload` module expects.

> If we shadows have offended,  
> Think but this, and all is mended,  
> That you have but slumber'd here  
> While these visions did appear.  
> And this weak and idle theme,  
> No more yielding but a dream,  
> Gentles, do not reprehend:  
> If you pardon, we will mend:  
> And, as I am an honest Puck,  
> If we have unearned luck  
> Now to 'scape the serpent's tongue,  
> We will make amends ere long;  
> Else the Puck a liar call;  
> So, good night unto you all.  
> Give me your hands, if we be friends,  
> And Robin shall restore amends.
